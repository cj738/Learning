        <br>
        <p>So far I have just been going at this for a week and I feel as though I have leaned a fair amount, I still have a long way to go to be proficient especially with JavaScript. 
            However, I strive to keep improving and one day be proficient. I will continue to learn new methods and try new things as I continue on this journey.
